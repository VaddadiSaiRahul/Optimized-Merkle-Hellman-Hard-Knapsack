# Optimized-Merkle-Hellman-Hard-Knapsack
Parallelized Dynamic Programming implementation of Hard Variant of Merkle-Hellman Knapsack for Public key encryption.<br>
This optimized variant, ensures increased security from cryptanalysis like Shamir's attack on the Traditional Merkle-Hellman Knapsack.<br>
Even though the hard variant involves solving an inefficient subset-sum compared to the traditional knapsack, through optimization it is ensured to work faster than<br>
the traditional variant on most system configurations (depends on the system!!!).<br>
Therefore, ensuring both speed and reliability of the system.
