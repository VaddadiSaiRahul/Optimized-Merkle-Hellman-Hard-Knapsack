# Optimized-Merkle-Hellman-Hard-Knapsack
. Parallelized Dynamic Programming implementation of Hard Variant of Merkle-Hellman Knapsack for Public key encryption.<br>

. This optimized variant, ensures increased security from cryptanalysis like Shamir's attack on the Traditional Merkle-Hellman Knapsack.<br>

. Even though the hard variant involves solving an inefficient subset-sum compared to the traditional knapsack, through optimization it is ensured to work faster than the           traditional variant on most system configurations (depends on the system!!!).<br>
  
. Therefore, ensuring both speed and reliability of the system.
